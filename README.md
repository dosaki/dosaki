| I'm a software developer from Portugal. Currently living in the UK.<br/>I work as a senior/lead dev at [Panintelligence](https://panintelligence.com), where I get to play with data and mentor our juniors.<br/>Online, I use '**Dosaki**' as my monicker.<br/>Building things is my passion and I've been doing it for quite some time.<br/>I run the python and javascript sessions for my local Code Club to help kids learn how to program and I mentor a promising group at a [CoderDojo]().<br/>You'll find I talk mostly about tech, video, board games... and containers. I talk a lot about containers. | ![Minime](./minime.jpg) |
